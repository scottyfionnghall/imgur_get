# Imgur imgs to markdown

I needed to embed a lot of images from imgur in a markdown file, so i created a script that takes a link to an imgur post and outputs a file with all the images links in a markdown style.

You do need a Imgur API accsess. Create .env file with this structure

``CLIENT_ID = ''``

``CLIENT_SECRET = ''``
